## Prerequisites

- **AWS Service Knowledge**: Basic understanding of AWS data processing services like Kinesis, Glue, and EMR

## Detailed Explanation

### What is Batch vs Streaming Data Processing?

Batch processing and streaming data processing are two fundamental paradigms for handling data in modern analytics and machine learning pipelines. Batch processing collects data over a period of time and processes it in scheduled, discrete chunks, while streaming data processing handles data continuously as it arrives, allowing for real-time or near real-time analysis and action.

### Key Characteristics

- **Processing Approach**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Processes large volumes of data in scheduled intervals (hourly, daily, weekly). Data is collected, stored, and then processed as a complete set. For Machine Learning, batch processing is "usually performed to a specific schedule" where data waits before processing begins, and new data must wait for the next batch processing cycle.
  - **Streaming Processing**: Processes data continuously as it arrives, with minimal latency between data generation and processing. Streaming data is "data that is emitted at high volume in a continuous, incremental manner with the goal of low-latency processing."

- **Latency**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Higher latency, as data must wait until the scheduled processing time. Suitable when results don't need to be immediate.
  - **Streaming Processing**: Very low latency, often processing data within seconds or milliseconds of its arrival. Streaming data processing allows "analysis and reporting of events as it happens" for use cases like fraud detection or intrusion detection.

- **Data Volume Handling**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Optimized for processing massive volumes of data efficiently, often with higher throughput.
  - **Streaming Processing**: Handles continuous data flows but may require more sophisticated scaling mechanisms for surges in data volume.

### How it Works

#### Batch Processing Flow:

1. **Data Collection**: Data is accumulated from various sources and stored in a repository (like S3)
2. **Trigger**: Based on a schedule or threshold, processing begins
3. **ETL Processing**: The data batch undergoes transformation using services like AWS Glue
4. **Analysis/ML**: The prepared data is used for analytics or machine learning model training
5. **Results Storage**: Results are stored for later use or reporting

#### Streaming Processing Flow:

1. **Data Capture**: Real-time data is captured immediately as it's generated
2. **Stream Ingestion**: Data enters a streaming service like Kinesis Data Streams
3. **Real-time Processing**: Data is processed on-the-fly, often with minimal transformation
4. **Immediate Analysis**: Insights are derived and actions taken immediately
5. **Optional Storage**: Data may be stored for historical analysis or compliance

### Practical Real World Use Cases

- **Batch Processing**:
  - **ML Model Training**: AWS Glue is "a popular choice for ingesting data as a batch process" for machine learning applications, using its crawler to process data in various formats.
  - **Financial Reporting**: End-of-day transaction processing and financial reporting where daily summaries are sufficient.
  - **Inventory Management**: Processes in inventory management use batch processing to collect data across sources and run machine learning algorithms to generate demand forecasts, utilizing the efficiency of compute resources for big data.

- **Streaming Processing**:
  - **Fraud Detection**: Financial institutions use streaming data to "track real-time changes in the stock market, compute value at risk, and automatically rebalance portfolios based on stock price movements."
  - **IoT Monitoring**: Sensors in vehicles, industrial equipment, and farm machinery send data to streaming applications that monitor performance and detect potential defects in advance.
  - **Real-time Recommendations**: Providing immediate personalized recommendations based on current user behavior.

## System Design Considerations

### Architecture Patterns

- **Batch Processing Patterns**:
  - **ETL Pipeline**: A classic pattern where data moves through Extract, Transform, Load stages at scheduled intervals.
  - **Data Lake Processing**: Data is stored in its raw form and processed in batches when needed, often using services like AWS Glue.

- **Streaming Patterns**:
  - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Systems react to streaming events as they occur.
  - **Lambda Architecture**: This architecture "unites batch and real-time analytics" using "fully managed, serverless AWS services" to process data from both streaming and batch sources.
  - **Kappa Architecture**: A simplified version focused on processing all data through the streaming pipeline.
